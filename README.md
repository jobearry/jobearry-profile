# React + TypeScript + Tailwind
**Portfolio | Jobearry**

My new and improved website using React, Typescript and TailwindCSS. These technologies are new to me aside from Typescript as I came from using Angular.

I used React instead of Angular just so I can Identify which I prefer in developing personal projects; so far, I am enjoying React.

Have a look 👀 \
Cheers! 🍻🍻🍻
